### Amazon Multilingual Keyphrase Generation Dataset

The first multilingual keyphrase generation dataset. It includes (`passage`, `keyphrases`) pairs in Spanish, French, German and Italian. 

We have splitted the dataset into train, dev and test set for each language (`<language>.<split>.json`).
Each instance in our dataset is in the `jsonl` format including the following entries:

- `id`: the unique id for the instance, it is the md5 hashing result of the product ASIN id.

- `title`: the title of the product.

- `context`: the passage description of the product.

- `keywords`: the keywords of the product, generated by a trained machine learning model.

- `lang`: the language of current instance.


In addition, we provide the Amazon English keyphrase generation dataset (`en.json`) for experimental replication purpose.
The instances in the `en.json` are of the same format with our multilingual dataset. The product appears in different languages share the same `id`.
